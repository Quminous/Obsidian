Bonding involves [[Atoms|atoms]] or coming together to form [[Molecules|molecules]] by sharing or giving away [[Electrons|electrons]]
# Bond Dissociation Energy
Bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond homolytically. In homolytic bond cleavage, one electron of the bond goes to each of its fragments, whereas in heterolytic bond cleavage only one fragment receives electrons, forming a cation and an anion.
Generally, the smaller the bond radius, the greater the bond dissociation energy. However, it is important to remember that bond dissociation energies should only be compared across similair bonds. Additionally, the type of orbital of the contributing electrons determines bond length, as s orbitals are smaller than p orbitals, for instance. As such, the greater the s characteristic, the shorter the bond, and therefore the higher the bond dissociation energy.

# Covalent Bonds
A covalent bond is formed between atoms when each contributes one or more of its unpaired valence electrons to complete both octets.
A covalent bond is said to be polar if the electron density between the two nuclei is uneven. This leads to the molecule having a dipole moment, and is denoted by the symbols $\delta^+$ and $\delta^-$. This only happens if there is a large electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms, as is the case if the two atoms are of different elements.
Coordinate covalent bonds occur when one atom donates both of the shared electrons in a bond. The molecule that donates the pair of electrons is known as a lewis base or ligand, while the molecule recieving the pair of electrons is known as a lewis acid. When this type of bond breaks, the ligand will take back the two electrons.

# Ionic Bonds
Ionic bonds are formed when one atom gives electrons to the other such that they both form a stable octet. They are then attracted by the resulting electronegativty difference, forming an ionic bond. For an ionic bond to form, there must be a large electronegativity difference between the atoms. The strength of an ionic bond is determined by the electrostatic force between the two atoms.
# $\sigma$ Bonds
A $\sigma$ bond consists of two electrons taht are localized between two nuclei. The numbering of a $\sigma$ bond depends on the hybridization state of the two orbitals. For instance, in $\text{CH}_4$, the bonds between the carbon and hydrogen would be described as $sp^3$-$s$ bonds, since the carbon has a tetrahedral shape, and therefore an orbital hybridization of $sp^3$, while hydrogen has no hybridization, and is therefore simply $s$.
# $\pi$ Bonds
A $\pi$ bond is formed by the proper, parallel, side-to-side alignment of two unhybridized $p$ orbitals on adjacent atoms. In a bond, there can only be on $\sigma$ orbital, the rest are $\pi$ orbitals. For instance, a double bond has one $\pi$ bond, while a triple bond has two $\pi$ bonds.

The geometry of a [[Molecules|molecule]] is determined by the types of [[Bonding|bonds]] it forms as well as the lone pair [[Electrons|electrons]].

# VSEPR Theory
Since electrons repel each other, electron pairs will always attempt to move as far apart as possible. These result in different molecular shapes. Importantly, the name of the molecular shape depends on the number of lone pairs.
# Hybridization
Orbital hybridization is the process whereby orbitals are hybridized in order to better predict the structure of a molecule. They can be determined using the following table.

| Electron Groups | Hybridization | Bond Angles             | Molecular Geometry                |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 2               | $sp$          | $\text{180}\textdegree$ | linear                            |
| 3               | $sp^2$        | $\text{120}\textdegree$ | trigonal planar/bent              |
| 4               | $sp^3$        | $109.5\textdegree$      | tetrahedral/trigonal pyramid/bent |
