An electron is a negatively charged fermion that orbits an atomic Nucleus.
# Orbiting
In the quantum model of the atom, electrons occupy diferent quantized states. These quantized states have four unique properties: shell, subshell, orbital, and spin. The orbital describes the three-dimensional region around the nucleus where an electron is most likely to be found and the subshell describes the shape and energy of an orbital
Each increasing energy shell contains one more subshell
The number of orientations an orbital can have increass by two for each successive subshell.
Electrons either spin up or spin down.
# Electron Configuration
To determine the electron configuration of a given atom, you follow the rules
1. Electrons occupy the lowest energy orbitals available
2. Electrons in the same subshell occupy available orbitals singly before pairing up
3. There can be no more than two electrons in a given orbital
The order of the shells goes s, p, d, f
The orbital conifguration of oxygen can be written as $1s^22s^22p^4$.
# Magnetism
Atoms where all electrons are spin paired are reffered to as diamagnetic and have no magnetic field meaning they are repelled by magnetic fields.
The opposite of this is a paramagnetic atom, where all the electrons are not spin paired, meaning they are attracted to magnetic fields.
Metals that require one more electron to either fill or half fill their $d$ orbital will promote an $s$ orbital to do so. For instance, an atom with the configuration $as^2bd^4$ will become $as^1bd^5$.
When an electron is excited, it can jump up to another energy level before the previous orbital is full.
