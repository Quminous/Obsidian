Alpha decay occurs when an unstable nucleus wants to lose two [[Neutrons]] and two [[Protons]]. This decay creates an $\alpha$ particle, denoted $^4_2\alpha$. Although this decay creates a particle with high energy, it has very little penetration power, and so is usually stopped by air or solid objects.
