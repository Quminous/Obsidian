The periodic table is a table of all of the possible [[Atoms|atomic]] configurations along with their atomic masses, listed by their number of protons. 

# Periodic Table Trends
## Nuclear Shielding
Nuclear shielding is the phenomena whereby every filled shell between the electron and the nucleus 'protects' the electron and thereby reduces the nuclear charge of the element.
## Atomic and Ionic Radius
As protons are added, that is, moving across the table, atomic radius decreases, as the protons have more of a pull on the electrons, moving them tighter.
As more shells are added, that is, moving down the table, atomic radius increases, as there is more shielding between the protons and electrons, causing them to drift further away

$\uparrow\text{down}$
## Ionization Energy
Ionization energy is the energy required to to remove the least tightly bound electron from an atom. As we move to the right across the table, electrons are held more closely by the increase in protons, increasing ionization energy. As we move down the table, there is more shielding, meaning it is easier to remove an outer electron.

## Electronegativity
Electronegativity is how easy it is for an atom to pull electrons to itself when forming covalent bonds. Electronegativity behaves them same as ionization energy. The nine most electronegative elements follow the order:

$\text{F}>\text{O}>\text{N}\approxeq\text{Cl}>\text{Br}>\text{I}>\text{S}>\text{C}\approxeq\text{H}$kk

## Acidity
Acidity is a measure of how well a compound donates protons, accepts electrons, or lowers pH. Generally, the more electronegative an element, the more stable the conjugate base, and therefore the greater the ease in donating protons. However, the larger the anion, the more the negative charge can be stabilized, reducing acidity.
