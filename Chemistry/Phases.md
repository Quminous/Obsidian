A phase change is the change of some molecule into a different physical form. Phase changes do not affect the intramolecular forces, that is, the [[Molecules|molecules]], but they do change the intermolecular forces.
As temperature (kinetic energy) increases ([[Thermodynamics|H]]), entropy
also increases. When the molecules finally have enough energy to move freely around eachother, a phase change from solid to liquid happens. As the molecules absorb enough energy to break their intermolecular bonds entirely, they turn in to gases.
Phase changes that bring molecules together release heat, while phase changes that spread out molecules absorb heat.
The types of face changes are:
* Melting/Fusion ($s\rightarrow l$)
* Sublimation ($s\rightarrow g$)
* Boiling/Vaporization ($l\rightarrow g$)
* Freezing/Crystallization ($l\rightarrow s$)
* Condensation ($g\rightarrow l$)
* Deposition ($g\rightarrow s$)
# Calorimetry
The heat of a phase change can be calculated using the formula:
$$q=n\times\Delta H_\text{phase change}$$
Every molecule and its associated phase changes have a different value of $\Delta H_\text{phase change}$.
In between phase changes, matter can absorb or release energy without undergoing transition, causing the temperature to raise. When a molecule is undergoing phase change, it will absorb energy without a change in temperature. 
The amount of heat absorbed is proportional to the change in temperature. This proportion is called the substances heat capacity ($C$), which is the product of its specific heat ($c$) and its mass. Essentially, the temperature change in a molecule given a certain amount of heat depends on its specific heat capacity.
$$q=mc\Delta T$$

Phase also depends on [[Pressure|pressure]]. As pressure increases, a substance is more likely to become a liquid or a solid. The triple point is the point where the substance is in equilibrium between a gas, a solid, and a liquid. At a high enough temperature and pressure, a substance will transition in to a supercritical fluid. This point is called the critical point.
There are some substances that are denser in the liquid phase than in the solid phase. This causes there to be a slightly negative slope between the solid and liquid phases as opposed to the slightly positive slope that is seen in most substances. An example of a substance with this unique density property is water.
Substances with this property are more inclided to become a liquid at high pressures as opposed to a solid like one would expect.
