An atom is a unit of a particular element. An atom contains a certain amount of [[Protons]] depending on its element, a certain amount of [[Neutrons]] depending on its isotope, and an equal number of [[Electrons]] to its protons. The protons and neutrons clump together to form the nucleus of the atom, while the electrons orbit around the atom in different quantized states.
# Isotopes
An atom is an isotope of another if they share the same number of protons, but differ in their number of neutrons. This change causes the atoms to have different atomic masses, despite being the same element. This can lead to slight differences in physical properties, but isotopes usually behave the same as each other.
# Atomic Weight
The atomic weight of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its naturally occuring isotopes. This is because atoms can naturally occur as different isotopes with different numbers of neutrons.
# Ions
An ion is an atom that has gained or lost [[electrons]]. Its element remains the same, because the number of protons has not changed, but it gains an electric charge depending on the number of electrons gained or lost. For instance, if an atom loses two electrons, it will become more positive, as represented by the superscript $^{2+}$. If it gains two electrons, it will become more negative, as represnted by the superscript $^{2-}$.

Ions that gain electrons always put them in to the lowest available energy level. Ions that lose electrons always lose them from the highest available energy level.

# [[Molecules]]

# Strong Nuclear Force
The strong nuclear force is the force that holds the nucleus of an atom together. It is the strongest fundamental force, but only operates over incredibly small distances.

# Emission Spectra
When an electric current is passed through the gaseous form of an element, it will glow with certain wave lengths that are unique to that element, called the emission spectrum. The wave length emitted can be found using the formula:

$E_\text{photon}=h\frac{c}{\lambda}$
# Bohr Atoms
A bohr atom is an atom with one electron. These atoms have very easy to produce atmoic spectra, but this model falls apart when dealing with multiple electron atoms.
