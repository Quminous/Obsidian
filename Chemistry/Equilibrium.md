When a reaction is at equilibrium, the [[Kinetics|rate]] of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backwards reaction. We can express the equilibrium constant for an equation using the formula:
$$K_\text{eq}=\frac{\prod [\text{Products]}^x}{\prod[\text{Reactants]}^y}$$
The value of $K_\text{eq}$ determines whether the reaction favours the reactants, the products, or the reactants and products are at relatively equal amounts during equilibrium. Equilibrium does not mean that the products are equal to the reactants, but that the concentration of these does not change over time.
# Reaction Quotient
We can use the equilibrium formula to determine the concentration of elements when the reaction is at equilibrium, but we can use a similar formula to determine the current ratio of the two products and reactants and compare it to the equilibrium constant to determine which way the reaction will proceed.$$Q=\frac{\prod [\text{Products]}^x}{\prod[\text{Reactants]}^y}$$
* $Q>K_\text{eq}$ reaction will proceed in the reverse direction
* $Q=K_\text{eq}$ reaction is at equilibrium
* $Q<K_\text{eq}$ reaction will proceed in the forward direction
# Le Chatelier's Principle
Le Chatelier's principle states that a system at equilibrium will attempt to neutralize any change in order to reestablish equilbrium. Essentially, if a system is at equilibrium and, for instance, more reactants are added, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction until the products are reactants are at equilbrium once more. This can apply to other changes as well, such as changing the volume, pressure, or temperature of a container. Adding a catalyst will not change the equilibrium of a reaction, since it effects the forward and backwards reactions equally, but it will still change the rate at which a system not at equilibrium attempts to reach equilibrium.
