There are two main definitions of acids and bases
1. Acids are [[Protons|proton]] donors, bases are proton acceptors
2. Lewis acids are [[Electrons|electron-pair]] acceptors, lewis bases are electron-pair donors
# Conjugate Acids and Bases
The base accepts the proton and, in doing so, becomes the conjugate acid, while the acid donates the proton and, in doing so, becomes the conjugate base.
# Strengths of Acids and Bases
Acids can be either strong or weak. Whether an acid is strong or weak depends on how completely it [[Solutions|ionizes]] in water. A strong acid will disociate completely, while a weak acid will only partially disociate.
The strength of an acid is directly related to how much the products are favored over the reactants, which can be shown using the [[Equilibrium|equilibrium]] expression $$K_\text{a}=\frac{[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}$$
The larger the value of $K_\text{a}$, the stronger the acid. Acids with a $K_\text{a}$ greater than 1 are considered to be strong acids.

| Name              | Formula      | Name            | Formula                 |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Hydroiodic acid   | $\text{HI}$  | Perchloric acid | $\text{HClO}_4$         |
| Hydrobromic acid  | $\text{HBr}$ | Sulfuric acid   | $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$ |
| Hydrochloric acid | $\text{HCl}$ | Nitric acid     | $\text{HSO}_4$          |
We can apply this same idea to bases, with the equation: $$K_\text{b}=\frac{[\text{HB}^+][\text{OH}^-}{[\text{B}]}$$
Common strong bases include
* Group 1 hydroxides
* Group 1 oxides
* Some group 2 hydroxides
* Metal amides
# Relative Strengths of Acid Base Pairs
The conjugate base of a strong acid has no basic properties in water
The conjugate base of a weak acid is a weak base
This also applies to the conjugate acids of bases.
An amphoteric substance is one that can be either an acid or a base. A good example of this is water.
# The Ion-Product Constant of Water
Water is amphoteric, and so it is always undergoing a process where it converts $2\text{H}_2\text{O}$ in to $\text{OH}^-$ and $\text{H}_3\text{O}$.
The amount of water that will undergo this process is very small ($K_\text{w}=1.0\times10^{-14}$ )
The introduction of acids and bases can disturb the equilibrium, but the product of the two molecules will always remain the same.
# pH
pH is the acidity of a given solution. It is a measure of the concentration of $H^+$ ions in the solution. It is given by the formula $$pH=-\log[\text{H}^+]$$
For strong acids, the amount of $\text{H}^+$ is directly proportional to the concentration of the acid, making the calculation quite simple.
For a weak acid you need the equilibrium constant to figure out how much of it will dissolve. The assumption that the amount dissolved is equal to the amount of $\text{H}^+$ still holds, so you can find the concentration using the formula.
$$K_\text{a}=\frac{x^2}{n-x}$$
# Neutralization Reactions
A neutralization reaction occurs when an acid and a base interact. Neutralization reactions always go to completion, as even weak acids or bases will continue to dissolve as their ions react with the other base or acid. The amount of a substance needed to neutralize another substance is always based on the amount of moles of OH or H.
# Hydrolysis of Salts
Salts will dissolve in water in to two ions. Some ions will not react at all with water, causing no change in the pH of the solution, while some others will. The notable factor to take into consideration is whether the ion is the conjugate acid or base of a weak acid or base. If it is, this means it is a better conjugate base or acid than water, causing the pH of the solution to change.
# Buffer Solutions
A buffer solution is one that resists small change in pH or POH when a small amount of acid or base is added.This comes from the presence of a weak acid and its conjugate base in roughly equal concentrations. $$\text{pH}=\text{p}K_\text{a}+\log(\frac{\text{[conjugate base]}}{\text{[weak acid]}})$$
To choose a weak acid for our buffer solution, we find one whose $pK_a$ is close to the desired pH. 
# Indicators
An indicator is a weak acid that undergoes a color change when it's converted to its conjugate base. To choose a good indicator, you find one who will transition colors around the desired $pK_a$. 
# Titrations
A titration is an experimental method used to determine the identity of an unknown acid or base based on its $\text{p}K_\text{a}$. Titrations can also be used to determine the concentration of an acid base solution.
To perform a titration, we add some amount of buffer solution and indicator and wait until the buffer solution becomes saturated. At the point the buffer solution becomes saturated, the pH will change dramatically, causing the indicator to change color. This is know as the equivalence point, and we should record the amount of moles that were added of the known titrant up to this point. 
The equivalence point is the point where the H and OH ions are equal in concentration. If our solution contains a weak acid or base, we will notice that the pH is not 7 like we would expect. This is because the weak acid or base will have a strong conjugate acid or base, causing the pH to change.
We can then divide this number by 2 to find the **half equivalence** point. At this point, we know that the concentration of our conjguate acid and conjugate base are equal. Using this information, we can then use the equation for pH to find that the pH at half-equivalence is equal to the $\text{p}K_\text{a}$ of the unknown solution.
For polyprotic acids (acids with more than one hydrogen atom) there will be multiple equivalence points, because mutiple hydrogen ions can be donated.
