Beta decay works by converting neutrons into protons or vice versa. The emitted particle is considerably ligther than an $\alpha$ particle, meaning it has much more penetrating power and is therefore significantly more dangerous.
# $\beta^-$ Decay
$\beta^-$ decay occurs when an unstable nucleus has too many neutrons. To resolve this, it will turn one neutron into a proton. In this process, one $\beta^-$ particle is lost. This particle is identical to an electron, and can be denoted $^0_{-1}\beta$. Because the atom is gaining a proton, its element will change, but the mass of the atom will remain the same.

$^{14}_6\text{C}\rightarrow^{14}_7\text{N}+^0_{-1}\beta$
# $\beta^+$ Decay
$\beta+$ decay occurs when a nucleus has too few neutrons, and so it converts a proton into a neutorn. In this process, one $\beta^+$ particle is emitted, which is a [[Positrons]] that is the antiparticle of the electron. This also causes a change in the element, as a proton is lost.

$^{18}_9\text{F}\rightarrow^{18}_8\text{O}+^0_{+1}\beta$
# Electron Capture
[[Electrons]] capture occurs when a nucleus wants to increase its number of neutrons. It does this by capturing an electron from its closest shell in order to convert a proton into a neutron. In the process, it emits an electron neutrino which carries the decay energy. It will cause a change in the element, as a proton is being lost.
