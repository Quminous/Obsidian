A molecule is a group of [[Atoms|atoms]] [[Bonding|bonded]] together.
# Lewis Dot Structure
The lewis dot structure is a way to represent atoms and molecules where the atom is surrounded by dots representing its valence electrons.
To make a lewis dot structure for a molecule, you simply 'pair up' the electrons in the atoms usnig lines to represent the number of bonds.
# Formal Charge
The optimal configuration for a molecule is when the sum of the absolute formal charges of all of its constituent atoms is equal to zero or as close to zero as possible. The formal charge can be calculated by subtracting half of the number of bonding electrons as well as the number of lone-paired electrons from the total number of valence electrons.

$\text{Formal Charge}=V-\frac{1}{2}B-L$

For molecules that must have a formal charge, the charge should be negative on the more electronegative elements.
# Resonance
If two lewis dot structures are found to be equally as likely for a molecule, we call them resonance hybrids and represent them using dotted lines in place of bonds.
# Polarity
If a molecule contains no polar bonds or only symmetrical non-polar bonds it is considered to be non polar. 
# Intermolecular Forces
Ion-dipole forces occur because polar molecules are attracted to ions.
Dipole-dipole forces occur when the negative end of one dipole is attracted to the positive end of another.
Dipole-induced dipoles occur when a polar molecule causes a dipole in another molecule.
Instantaneous dipole-induced dipoles occur when two non-polar molecules are attracted because of brief changes in electron density. Also called London dispersion force.
Hydrogen bonding occurs between Hydrogen and either Nitrogen, Oxygen, or Fluorine when the previously mentioned elements have lone pairs of electrons. The hydrogen will bond with the afformentioned element, forming a hydrogen bond. This is the strongest type of intermolecular force.
# Vapor Pressure
Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the gaseous phase of a liquid that evaporated. The weaker a substance's intermolecular forces, the higher its vapour pressure and the more easily it evaporates. Easily vaporized liquids are said to be volatile.
# Types of Solids
## Ionic Solids
Held together by electrostatic attraction and forms a lattice or crystal-like structure. 
Network solids are held together in a lattice of covalent bonds. Because of this, there are technically only intramolecular forces, making them very hard.
Metallic solids are made up of metals and have a sea of electrons throughout them that are shared. Because of this, they are very good conductors and are highly malleable.
Molecular solids are held together by intermolecular forces only, making them very weak.
