A Nucleus is radioactive if it undergoes radioactive decay due to being unstable. The nucleus that undergoes radioactive decay is the parent, while the resulting, more stable nucleus is known as the daughter.

# Half-Life
Different radioactive nuclei decay at different rates. This is measured by the half-life, which represents the amount of time it will take for half of a smaple of that nuclei to decay on average. This decay can be represnted by the formula:

$N=N_0(1/2)^{T/t_{1/2}}$
$T$ Time elapsed
$t_{1/2}$ Half-life
$N_0$ Starting Mass
$N$ FinaL mass
# Nuclear Stability
The stability of an atom's nucleus depends on the number and orientation of its protons and neutrons. Stability can be measured using binding energy (keV), where a higher binding energy means the nucleus is more stable. 
Since protons have a positive charge, they will repel each other due to the electrostatic force, leading to a decrease in binding energy. Neutrons act as a buffer between protons to reduce the electrostatic repulsion effect between them which in turn increases binding energy. Therefore an excess of electrons will decrease binding energy due to an increase in electrostatic replusion.
An excess of neutrons will also decrease binding energy. This is because protons and neutrons are independent fermions like electrons. Protons and neutrons will always try to occupy the lowest energy states, much like electrons as well. Therefore, if there is an excess of neutrons, the neutrons will be occupying higher energy levels, and will therefore be more stable if they decay into protons which can occupy lower energy levels.
# Nuclear Binding Energy
Nuclear binding energy is the energy that was released when the nucleus was bonud together by the strong nuclear force. It is also, conversly, the energy it would take to break up the intact nuecleus. The binding energy can be found by taking the mass defect, that is the mass difference between the nucleons before binding and the total mass of the nucleus, and using it to find energy.

$\Delta m=m_{\text{nucleons}}-m_\text{nucleus}$

$E_B=\Delta mc^2$
