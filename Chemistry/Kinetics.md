Kinetics is the study of how reactions take place and how fast they occur. They do not determine if a reaction occurs, that is, is [[Thermodynamics|energetically favourable]].
# Reaction Rates
The rate of a reaction is determined by the slowest step in the process. It is influenced by:
1. How frequently the reactant molecules collide
2. The orientation of the colliding molecules
3. The energy of the colliding molecules
Activation energy ($E_a$) is the minimum energy required of reactants during collision for a reaction to proceed. Concerning reaction rate, we can make the following observations:
* The lower the activation energy, the faster the reaction rate
* The greater the concentration of reactants, the faster the reaction rate
* The greater the temperature, the faster the reaction rate
# Catalysts
Catalysts work by decrease activation energy. They can accomplish this by either speeding up the rate determining step, or providing a more efficient reaction mechanism. A catalyst can be changed during a reaction, but it must always return to its original state by the end of the reaction.
# Rate Laws
The rate law of a reaction is the rate at which the reactants dissipate. Reactants that do not affect the rate of the reaction are not included in the rate law. The rate law can be expressed as:
$$\text{rate}=k\prod[N]^x$$
The rate law can only be experimentally determined. That is, the effect of each reactant on the reaction rate can only be found by holding the other reactants constant and seeing how the rate changes. Additionally, the rate constant can only be found experimentally.
The rate constant can be further understood as a function involving the orientation of molecules when they collide ($A$), the activation energy of the reaction, and the temperature of the reaction.
$$k=Ae^{-(E_a/RT)}$$
