$\gamma$ decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited energy state wants to relax back to its ground state. To do this, it will release $\gamma$ [[Photons]]. This has no effect on the neutrons, electrons, or protons of the atom. $\gamma$ photons are much more dangerous compared to regular photons, as they have a higher energy level and shorter wavelength. They can only be stopped by very dense materials, such as lead.
