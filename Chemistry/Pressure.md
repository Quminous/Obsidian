# Ideal Gas Law
Ideal gases are gases that are assumed to have certain sets of properties.
1. Near zero volume
2. Constant motion
3. Elastic collisions
4. No intermolecular forces
5. $KE_\text{avg}\propto T$
The ideal gas law can be used to describe the relationship between pressure, heat, volume, [[Thermodynamics|temperature]], and moles.
$$PV=nRT$$
# Real Gas Law
The real gas law does not make some of the same assumptions as the ideal gas law. Namely, as the amount of gas increases, we know that the remaining volume in the container must decrease, as gas particles take up a nonzero amount of space. Additonally, we know that there are intermolecular forces between gas molecules, meaning collisions are not perfectly elastic. To account for this difference, we substract some amount from $V$ depending on the amount of particles and their size ($nb$) and add a term to account for intermolecular forces ($\frac{an^2}{V^2}$).
$$(P+\frac{an^2}{V^2})(V-nb)=nRT$$
The difference in pressure using the real gas law as compared to the ideal gas law is greatest for large molecules and molecules that experience large intermolecular forces, such as $\text{H}_2\text{O}$.
# Partial Pressures
Dalton's law of partial pressures states that the total pressure in a container is the sum of the pressures of all of the gases in that container.
$$P_\text{tot}=\sum(p_n)$$
Additionally, we can calculate the partial pressure of a gas if we are given the total pressure and the fraction of the moles in the container that belong to that gas.
$$p_n=X_nP_\text{tot}$$
# Effusion
Assuming two gases are at equal partial pressures in a container, the rate of effusion is dependent on their molar masses.
$$\frac{\text{rate of effusion of Gas A}}{\text{rate of effusion of Gas B}}=\sqrt{\frac{\text{molar mass of Gas B}}{\text{molar mass of Gas A}}}$$
This relationship holds because the gases have the same amount of [[Kinetics|kinetic energy]] ($K_e$), but since their masses are different, they will have different velocities ($v$).
