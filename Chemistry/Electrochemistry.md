# Oxidation and Reduction Reactions
When an atom gains [[Electrons|electrons]], the oxidation number decreases, called oxidation.
When an atom loses electrons,  the oxidation number increases, called reduction.
# Galvanic Cells
The cathode is the site of reduction, while the anode is the site of oxidation. Electrons always flow from the anode to the cathode.
The salt bridge is crucial as it allows ions to flow between the cathodic solution and anodic solution, helping to maintain neutrality between them. This neutrality is necessary so that charge does not collect around the anode and the cathode, leaing to a stoppage of the reaction. If a salt bridge is not present, the galvanic cell will act like a capacitor instead, storing the electricty due to the seperation of charge on the adjacent surfaces.
# Standard Reduction Potentials
Each half-reaction of the galvanic cell has a potential ($E\textdegree$). The sum of these potentials is the overall cell voltage.
The free charge [[Thermodynamics|energy]] $\Delta G\textdegree$ is given by the formula $$\Delta G\textdegree=-nFE\textdegree$$
From this, we can see that, if the overall cell voltage is positive, the reaction will occur spontaneously, as $\Delta G\textdegree$ will be negative.
If ther assumptions of standard values do not hold, we can use the nerst equation to find the voltage instead. $$E=E\textdegree-(RT/nF)\ln Q$$
# Electrolytic Cells
An electrolytic cell works the opposite of a galvanic cell. Instead of making an electron charge using a redox reaction, it causes a redox reaction using an electric charge, known as electrolysis.
