A solution is formed when one substance dissolves into another forming a homogenous mixture. Solutes will dissolve best in solvents where the intermolecular forces being broken in the solute are being replaced by equal or stronger intermolecular forces between the solvent and the solute.
# Ionizability
The ionizability factor tells us how many ions a susbtance will produce in a solution. For example, a substance that does not dissolve will have an $i$ of 1, A substance that produces two ions will have an $i$ of 2, and so on.
# Solubility
Solubility refers to the amount of solute that will saturate a particular solvent. The phase solubility rules determine how solubility works between liquids and gases.
1. For solids in liquids, $\uparrow \text{temperature}\rightarrow\text{ }\uparrow\text{solubility}$
2. For gases in liquids,  $\uparrow \text{temperature}\rightarrow\text{ }\uparrow\text{solubility}$
3. For gases in liquids,  $\uparrow \text{pressure}\rightarrow\text{ }\uparrow\text{solubility}$
For salts in water there are additional rules
* All Group I ions and ammonium are soluble
* nitrate and perchlorate and acetate are soluble
* Silver, lead, and mercury are insoluble except for their nitrates, perchlorates, and acetates.
The solubiity product constant can be calculated similarly to an [[Equilibrium|equilbrium]] equation. Keep in mind that the solids are not included in the equation. The solubility product constant tells us when a solution is saturated.
# Ion Product
Similarly to equilbrium constants, we can calculate the current level of dissolution $Q_\text{sp}$ and compare it to $K_\text{sp}$. This will then tell us whether the solution is saturated, more salt can be dissolved, or excess salt will precipitate.
If two salts have the same ion product when dissolved, this leads to the common-ion effect, where dissolving another different salt can actually change the solubility constant because there is an excess of one of the product ions.
# Complex Ion Formation
Metallic ions can be surrounded by ligands, increasing their solubility. An example of a real world use case for this is in the creation of compounds for lead poisoning. Essentially, the compound acts as a ligand, increasing the solubility of lead, and allowing it to pass through the blood stream.
# Thermodynamics and Equilibrium
We can relate $\Delta G\textdegree$ to $K_\text{eq}$ using the formula $$\Delta G\textdegree=-RT\ln{K_\text{eq}}$$
