Enthalpy is a measure of the heat energy that is released or absorbed when [[Bonding|bonds]] are broken or formed.
When a bond is formed, energy is released. $\Delta H<0$
Breaking a bond requires energy. $\Delta H >0$
In a chemical reaction, $\Delta H$ is equal to the $H$ of the products minus the $H$ of the reactants. $\Delta H=H_\text{products}-H_\text{reactants}$
# Laws
0. If two systems are at equilibrium with a third, then the previous two are at equilibrium with eachother. $$\forall a,b,c\in X:(aRb\wedge bRc)\Rightarrow aRc$$
1. The total energy of the universe is constant.
# Standard Conditions
Standard conditions are the arbitrary set of assumptions made when calculating a thermodynamic equation. They are represented by the superscript $\textdegree$. The standard value for temperature is $298\space K$ ($25\textdegree C$), the standard value for pressure is $1\space atm$, and solutions are assumed to be at a concentration of $1\space M$. Values that have been determined at these standard values are also denoted with the superscript $\textdegree$ (e.g. $\Delta H\textdegree$).
# Heat of Formation
The standard heat of formation $\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f}$ is the amount of energy required to make one mole of a compound from its constituent elements in their natural and standard state. Keep in mind that many gases are naturally occuring as diatomic structures (e.g. $\text{O}_2$), and so the $\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f}$ of the diatomic molecule is zero while the $\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f}$ of the element is positive, since it takes energy to break apart the diatomic bond.
When $\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f}$ is positive, then heat is required to make that compound, whereas when $\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f}$ is negative, making the compound gives off energy. 
Therefore, you can calculate the $\Delta H\textdegree_\text{rxn}$ using the formula:
$$\Delta H\textdegree_\text{rxn}=(\sum n\times\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f, products})-(\sum n\times\Delta H\textdegree_\text{f, reactants)}$$
# Hess's Law of Heat Summation
Hess's law states that if a reaction has multiple steps, then the total energy will be equal to the sum of the energies of the steps in the reaction.
$$\Delta H_\text{rxn}=\sum\Delta H_n$$
Keep in mind that if a reaction is reversed, the $\Delta H$ is as well, and that if an equation is multiplied by a coefficient, then $\Delta H$ must be multiplied by that value too.
# Summation of Bond Energies
Since energy is needed to break a bond, and energy is released in breaking a bond, we can use the bond dissociation energy in order to calculate $\Delta H_\text{rxn}$ $$\Delta H_\text{rxn}=\sum(\text{BDE bonds broken})-\sum(\text{BDE bonds formed})$$
# Laws
2. Entropy increases in isolated systems; heat flows from hot to cold.
3. Entropy approaches a constant value as temperature approaches absolute zero.
# Entropy
Entropy is the measure of disorder in a system. All closed systems tend towards disorder. Entropy is denoted by the symbol $S$ and the change in entropy can be denoted usign the formula $\Delta S=S_\text{products}-S_\text{reactants}$.
Generally, entropy is predictable following the rules:
* $S_\text{gases}>S_\text{liquids}>S_\text{solids}$ ([[Phases|the phase]])
* $S_\text{dissolved}>S_\text{sediment}$
* $M_{xa}>M_{xb}\rightarrow S_{xa}>S_{xb}$
* $\Delta S_\text{reverse}=-\Delta S_\text{forward}$
Absolute zero is defined as the temperature where $S=0$.
# Gibbs Free Energy
The magnitude of the change in Gibbs free energy $\Delta G$ is the amount of [[Thermodynamics|energy]] that is available to do useful work for a chemical reaction. $\Delta G$ can be used to determine the spontaneity of a reaction:
* $\Delta G<0\rightarrow \text{spontaneous in the foward direction}$
* $\Delta G=0\rightarrow\text{equilibrium}$ [[Equilibrium]]
* $\Delta G>0\rightarrow \text{nonspontaneous in the forward direction}$
$\Delta G$ can be calculated using the formula:
$$\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S$$
As this formula shows, at low temperatures entropy has relatively little effect on $\Delta G$, but at higher temperatures it can become a deciding factor.
